    * Improved variant calling pipeline and post-calling processing
    * Developed and implemented state-of-the-art statistical evaluation of variants in case-control scenario

## Research Experience
  - Primary bioinformatics researcher - Evaluation of endogenous viruses footprints in PD and MS patients via raw single-cell RNA sequencing data (ongoing)
    * Developed and improved research questions
    * Constructed custom reference transcriptomes and evaluated their coverage
    * Active literature review, manuscript writing, and downstream data analysis steps

  - Meta-evaluation of bulk gene expression datasets of colorectal cancer patients focusing on expanding the discovery of cancer driver pathways
    * Corrected reasearch question, formulation, and statistical logic
    * Primary analyst
 
  - Master's thesis
    * Developed an extensive analysis pipeline for evaluation of short mutations (SNVs,Indels), copy-number variations (CNVs), runs of homozygosity (ROHs), and short tandem repeats (STRs) to improve diagnostic rate
    * Resolved many variant interpretation conflicts
    * Variant verification via segregation study and Sanger sequencing
